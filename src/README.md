## Advent of Code 2021 ##

`Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can
be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training,
university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
`

I have taken a stab at some of the problems from Advent of Code 2021.

I tried to solve the problems as simple as possible and also with good readability.

Hope you find the solutions helpful and easily understandable.

Thanks.
